Apart from these, we can also extract matching custom regular expressions including POS tag patterns, or look for statements involving an entity, subject-verb-object tuples etc. We will discuss some of these as they come, in this chapter. \n","\n","Documentation: https://chartbeat-labs.github.io/textacy/build/html/index.html"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8CLBcNUXzJsZ"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
